## Passion for Learning

I'm deeply passionate about learning new things and continually expanding my knowledge. Whether it's through my academic pursuits, personal projects, or content creation, I strive to stay curious and engaged with the latest in technology.

## Projects

Here are a few projects that I'm currently working on:

- **[Graph_Designer_Project](https://github.com/Zineeddine-Abd/Graph_Designer_Project.git)**: A Java application designed to allow users to create custom graphs and trees and apply algorithms to them. Built using pure Java and Java Swing. The project is functional but still a work in progress.
